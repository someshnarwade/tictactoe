## About
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

## Learning Outcomes
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using functions, handling errors, and processing user input.

## Steps
1. To begin the project, the program needs to be able to print any state of the field. Step 1 focusses on producing a multi-line program using a lot of print statements.

2. Next analyze user input and print the state of the field depending on it. A key point is to address specific positions in a string to achieve the required outcome. 

3. Now a fully-functioning multi-line program is developed that responds to the user’s actions and analyzes the state of the field. It tracks who is winning and determines if the situation on a given field is theoretically possible! 

4. To actually play the game a program is required that can change the state of the field, and step 4 takes this to a fully-functioning game application! 

5. Finally play the game!
